This is a simple web viewer for GPS tracks uploaded with mobile client.
It is designed to work with Android version of great app TrackMe (http://www.luisespinosa.com/trackme_eng.html), 
but it should be easy to adjust it for other clients (other database tables).
Interface "look and feel" is based on TrackMe Display (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=477394).
It is possible to switch between Google Maps API and OpenLayers API with OpenStreetMap (or any other compatible base layer).
It also supports Backitude client (thanks to markcs: see README_Backitude).
